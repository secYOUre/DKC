The game Dining Kid Cryptographers (DKC) is a non-digital game developed 
primarily for education and science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) outreach. The digital materials for DKC are released 
here, as open-source products. These materials are of two forms:

tgc-print
=========
Contains SVG and 300dpi PNG artwork, in a format appropriate to print using 
The Game Crafter (http://thegamecrafter.com/), i.e. full-bleed artwork for 
TGC print house.


self-print
==========
Contains SVG and 300dpi PNG artwork, masked so it can be directly printed 
and cut-out at home (no margins for cut or bleed).

We recognize our self-print process is currently not very user-friendly.
We are interested in improving it, and you might consider helping us.


masters
=======
The original Scalable Vector Graphics files for generating the versions 
of the game art and rules booklet.
